            <p>Hi! I'm a 4th year engineering physics student at UBC with a focus on software development. I enjoy programming and have experience with backend web development, object-oriented programming, embedded programming, and scripting. I'm also a big physics nerd and really enjoy helping people love it as much as I do by TAing some of my favourite physics courses. After taking a course in operating systems, I have become really interested in this field and have started doing research with the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at UBC with Dr.Fedorova.</p>
            <p> I am a big fan of the outdoors. In my free time you can find me running on local trails, skiing at local mountains, and biking around the city. I occasionally climb rocks too!</p>
