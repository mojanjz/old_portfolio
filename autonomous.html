        <h1>Autonomous Robot Project </h1>
        <p>This project was part of the Engineering Physics 253 Robot Course. Our robot was tasked with autonomously navigating a course to collect and safely deposit Infinity Stones - all while racing against another robot trying to do the same thing! Throughout the term, our team focused on interdisciplinary learning, and building a robot that was consistent, creative, and functional given our time and resource constraints.</p>
